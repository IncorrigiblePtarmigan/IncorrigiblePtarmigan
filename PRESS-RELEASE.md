## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.

Generate stress-free, socially harmonious seating charts with the click of a button!

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.

Take the emotion out of seating arrangements -- let our app do the hard work for you!

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.

Making a seating chart can be one of the most stressful parts of planning your wedding or other big event. Not only do you have to keep track of who needs to sit near Aunt Millie and which friends will certainly offend your grandparents, but you’re usually stuck with creating the chart towards the end of the event planning process, when you have the least amount of time and emotions are high. 

Wouldn’t it be great if an app could do the hard work for you? 

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.

Our app takes the emotion out of seating charts. All you have to do is add your guest list and note who should be seated together (and who needs to be kept apart!). With the click of a button, our app will generate a socially harmonious seating chart that you can use right away for your big event! 

Changing the chart is easy, so you don’t have to wait for all your RSVPs before getting started. Need to add a plus-one? Have a last minute cancellation? No problem. Add your changes, and our app will update your chart in seconds.

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.

“I’m really happy to work on an app that helps people so tangibly!”
“This app saves hours of time and makes event planning less stressful.” 
“It has so many applications when you think about it”

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.

Just head to www.[APP_NAME_TBD].com and input your guest list to get started! You’ll have a full seating chart within minutes.

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.
